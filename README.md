# ML_RG_mapping
Repository that contains the source code of the U-Net ANN implementation of the paper "Machine learning – An approach for consistent rock glacier mapping and inventorying – Example of Austria"

The paper is published in the Journal "Applied Computing and Geosciences" with the DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acags.2022.100093

This U-Net Implementation is a modified version of
https://github.com/malhotraa/carvana-image-masking-challenge
which was created for the kaggle challange: Carvana Image Masking Challenge
https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge

Modifications concern the size of layers so that it fits the purpose of the
publication. Further information is available in the paper.
